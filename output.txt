Jem said Mr. I never knew how old Mr Radley made his living Jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing but Mr. The next day Dill said You re too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard Jem said he reckoned he wasn t he d passed the Radley Place every school day of his life. Lemme think a minute it s sort of like making a turtle come out How s that asked Dill Strike a match under him I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him 17 Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful Ain t hateful just persuades him s not like you d chunk him in the fire Jem growled How do you know a match don t hurt him Turtles can t feel stupid said Jem Were you ever a turtle huh My stars Dill Now lemme think reckon we can rock him Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession I won t say you ran out on a dare an I ll swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the house Jem brightened. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight but Jem figured that Mr. I d like to see what he looks like Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn t get any farther than the Radley gate. If you are then Dill you have to think about these things Jem said. Radley s boy was not seen again for fifteen years But there came a day barely within Jem s memory when Boo Radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by Jem. 16 Always runnin I said But Dill got him the third day when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly weren t as afraid as the folks in Maycomb that he d never seen such scary folks as the ones in Maycomb This was enough to make Jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the light pole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge I hope you ve got it through your head that he ll kill us each and every one Dill Harris said Jem when we joined him. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. He said Atticus never talked much about the Radleys when Jem would question him Atticus s only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said Mm mm mm So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing. He said it began the summer Dill came to us when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with Andrew Jackson. He ll probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then Scout n me ll jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we ain t gonna hurt him We left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house and stopped at the gate Well go on said Dill Scout and me s right behind you I m going said Jem don t hurry me He walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head Then I sneered at him Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead When Dill reduced Dracula to dust and Jem said the show sounded better than the book I asked Dill where his father was You ain t said anything about him I haven t got one Is he dead No Then if he s not dead you ve got one haven t you Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush a sure sign that Dill had been studied and found acceptable. People said he existed but Jem and I had never seen him. Ain t scared just respectful Jem said. You started it remember You re still scared murmured Dill patiently Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasn t scared of anything It s just that I can t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us Besides Jem had his little sister to think of When he said that I knew he was afraid. Radley took Arthur home people said the house died But there came a day when Atticus told us he d wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Radley went under Boo would come out but it had another think coming Boo s elder brother returned from Pensacola and took Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. The sheriff hadn t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes so Boo was locked in the courthouse basement Boo s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem s memory Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. The doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as Sundays and Mr. Looks like he d just stick his head out the door Jem said He goes out all right when it s pitch dark 15 Miss Stephanie Crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her said his head was like a skull lookin at her. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children Radley pecans would kill you. Radley s place. He was thirty three years old then Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out The Radley Place fascinated Dill. Tell it to us he said Dill was a curiosity. Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at night I ve seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night I heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time Atticus got there Wonder what he looks like said Dill Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo Boo was about six and a half feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch that s why his hands were bloodstained if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off. It was all right to shut him up Mr Radley conceded but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal. Radley thought it was. Bet it s a foot longer Folks call me Dill said Dill struggling under the fence Do better if you go over it instead of under it I said. You got anything needs readin I can do it How old are you asked Jem four and a half Goin on seven Shoot no wonder then said Jem jerking his thumb at me. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. But to climb the Radley front steps and call He y of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did The Radley house had no screen doors. Dubose was plain hell That was the summer Dill came to us Early one morning as we were beginning our day s play in the back yard Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford s collard patch. Radley s elder son lived in Pensacola he came home at Christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place 14 From the day Mr. In all his life Jem had never declined a dare Jem thought about it for three days. We stared at him until he spoke Hey Hey yourself said Jem pleasantly I m Charles Baker Harris he said. Radley walking to and from town. She gave the money to Dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it Don t have any picture shows here except Jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said Jem. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law and we believed her because Mr. I suppose he loved honor more than his head for Dill wore him down easily You re scared Dill said the first day. I once 11 asked Atticus if it ever had any Atticus said yes but before I was born According to neighborhood legend when the younger Radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. I maintain that the Ewells started it all but Jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that
